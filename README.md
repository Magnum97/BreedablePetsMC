# BreedablePetsMC
Breed parrots and polar bears. Customize the food/item you use to tame each mob.

**Breedable Pets** is a [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) server plugin for [Bukkit](http://http://bukkit.org) / [Spigot](http://spigotmc.org) / [Paper](http://papermc.io) that allows you to breed animals that are not usually breedable.

### Installation

Drop the jar in your plugins folder and start the server.

## Usage
There is only one command, `/breedablepets` alias `/bp`. Sub commands are:
- `parrotegg`
- `reload` and
- `help`

For settings see [config.yml](https://github.com/Magnum97/BreedablePetsMC/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml)\
I tried to put all options in there. Some are not implemented yet. \
Currently only parrots are breedable. You must feed them seeds *other* than wheat. Wheat seeds are still used for taming wild parrots. Foods are hard coded but plan to move to config in a future version.

### Contributing
This is a pretty basic plugin. If you have any thoughts, good or bad, I would like them or any suggestions for features or improvements.\
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
